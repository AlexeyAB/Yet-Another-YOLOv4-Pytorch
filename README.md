# Yet-Another-YOLOv4-Pytorch

This is another YOLOv4 implementation for pytorch. I try to write code manualy, so it will be easily understandable and fully readable. For example, with minor code transformations you can add more layers to the model. I will try to implement all staff written in paper.
